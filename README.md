# Squall

An easy weather app allowing the user to to view current conditions in multiple cities.

## Description 

Travel is complex, stressful, and unpredictable, and that's before taking into account what the weather will be once you reach your destination. Squall was designed to take some of the guesswork out of that equation, enabling a traveler on the go to easily see detailed current conditions in any city of their choosing, as well as a five day forecast detailing temperature, humidity, and real feel. Utilizing the openweathermap API and built using dynamically rendered HTML, JQUERY, and Bootstrap, Squall is built to have a low data footprint, and to be as responsive as possible to different devices.

## Features

- Simple: Squall's trio of API calls execute with the push of a button, rendering all your weather data at a glance within a simple, unobtrusive layout

- Light: Squall's codebase is built to be efficient, so it loads quick when you need it 
 
- Persistant: Want to double check the weather at the last location you searched? Squall saves your last searched locale, so that you can easily check and re-check up to the minute weather data and make informed choices about your destination.

- Easy to read: Weather icons and color coding give Squall easy readability in a minimum of time. Color-coded UV index readouts mean you can decide how much sunscreen to pack in the blink of an eye.

## Installation

Squall is available to clone for personal use, or for deployment to any local intranet or dedicated server.
